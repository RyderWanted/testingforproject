            <h2>Conducted Survey Among the Public & Students</h2>
            <p> This survey was conducted based on Sustainability & Greenery in Qatar. 
                We've asked Age Groups between 17-20 and 30-45 about what they think about 
                Qatar taking the steps to embrace sustainability and bring it within the 
                country and community, in the peoples' daily lives and the environment which 
                surround us. We've spoke with people around the public, teachers and even 
                students, about their familiarity with Qatar's Vision 2023 for Sustainability 
                and these were the results of our research. 

                We have asked a range of questions from our students including students in <b>Qatar National Library</b>

                According to these graphs, it shows us how people have differently responded to each questionnaire. We have mostly received positive feedback from the community and our students.
                And We hope to see Qatar bringing more sustainability within our country and environment. We have also recorded 3-5 interviews for you to take a glimpse at!
